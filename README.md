jpa-lambda-integration-test
===========================

Testing the JPA 2.1 with JDK 8 Lambda expressions.

This project contains a simple test with JPA 2.1, using Hibernate 4.3.5.Final and Eclipselink 2.5.1.

There is only one JPA entity, Description, which contains a method with a Lambda expression in it's body.

The Eclipselink doesn't recognize the Description entity.
